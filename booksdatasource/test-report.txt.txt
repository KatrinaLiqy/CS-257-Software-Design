====Bugs that we found and fixed in our code====

We first changed, in line 11, the name of the source  file and csv file so that BooksDataSourceTest.py can open the correct files for testing.

Then we delete the indentation in line 64 and 65 so that main() is outside of the class. We got this trick in StackOverflow. Otherwise it would only have 0 tests.

In test_book_case_sensitivity, test_book_search_text, test_sort_year, test_start_year, and test_end_year, we changed author_id to an integer.

In test_start_year, we changed the order in which the books were listed so that they are sorted by title.

====Bugs that we found in your implementation====

In test_sort_authors we found out that when booksdatasource.py read the author file in line 52 it does not use int() for death_year like "'birth_year':int(row[3])" in line 54, so row[4] is taken in as a string rather than an integer.
