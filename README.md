# CS-257-Software-Design

CS 257 Software Design is a computer science course at Carleton College. Instructed by professor Jeff Ondich, I took the class in Fall 2020. This repository contains code I wrote for coursework, homework and projects.
Specifically, the covid19 folder contains our final project which is a web application that displays natural disaster information by countries. It utilizes postgres database and applied SQL queries in HTTP-based API implementation with Flask.
