    <p>
        <li class=request>REQUEST: /state/{state-abbreviation}/daily</li>

        RESPONSE: a JSON list of dictionaries, each of which represents the
        COVID-19 statistics from the specified state on a single date. Each
        dictionary will have the following fields.

        date -- YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. "2020-10-08")
        state -- upper-case two-letter state abbreviation (e.g. "MN")
        deaths -- (integer) the number of deaths on this date
        positive -- (integer) the number of positive COVID-19 tests on this date
        negative -- (integer) the number of negative COVID-19 tests on this date
        hospitalizations -- (integer) the number of new hospitalizations
        for COVID-19 on this date
    </p>
    <p>
        <li class=request>REQUEST: /state/{state-abbreviation}/cumulative</li>
        RESPONSE: a single JSON dictionary representing the cumulative
        statistics for the specified state. The dictionary will have the
        following fields.

        start_date -- YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. "2020-10-08")
        end_date -- YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. "2020-03-11")
        state -- upper-case two-letter state abbreviation (e.g. "MN")
        deaths -- (integer) the total number of deaths between the
        start and end dates (inclusive)
        positive -- (integer) the number of positive COVID-19 tests
        between the start and end dates (inclusive)
        negative -- (integer) the number of negative COVID-19 tests
        between the start and end dates (inclusive)
        hospitalizations -- (integer) the number of hospitalizations
        between the start and end dates (inclusive)

    </p>
    <p>
        <li class=request>REQUEST: /states/cumulative?sort=[deaths|cases|hospitalizations]</li>
        RESPONSE: a JSON list of dictionaries, each representing the
        cumulative COVID-19 statistics for each state. The dictionaries are
        sorted in decreasing order of deaths, cases, or hospitalizations,
        depending on the value of the GET parameter "sort". If sort is not
        present, then the list will be sorted by deaths. Each dictionary
        will have the same fields as in the
        /state/{state-abbreviation}/cumulative endpoint response.
