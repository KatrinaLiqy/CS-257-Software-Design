            Natural disasters are major adverse events resulting from natural processes of the Earth; A natural
            disaster
            can cause loss of life or damage property, and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the
            severity of which depends on the affected population's resilience (ability to recover) and also on the
            infrastructure available.
            <br>
            <br>
            An adverse event will not rise to the level of a disaster if it occurs in an area without a vulnerable
            population.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our website is able to provide a full collection of disaster events for three genres of natural
            disaster, earthquake, tsunami, and volcano eruptions.

            </h3>

            An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The earth has
            four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle
            make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet.
            But this skin is not all in one piece â€“ it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface
            of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another
            and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates
            are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the
            earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get
            stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges
            unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.

                    ERUPTION</a>
            </h3>

            Deep within the Earth it is so hot that some rocks slowly melt and become a thick flowing substance called
            magma. Since it is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in magma chambers.
            Eventually, some of the magma pushes through vents and fissures to the Earth's surface. Magma that has
            erupted is called lava.
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions
            Volcanic eruptions are expulsion of lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and
            assorted gases from a volcanic vent or fissure.

            https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-volcanoes-erupt?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products
            Explosive volcanic eruptions can be dangerous and deadly. They can blast out clouds of hot tephra from the
            side or top of a volcano. These fiery clouds race down mountainsides destroying almost everything in their
            path. Ash erupted into the sky falls back to Earth like powdery snow. If thick enough, blankets of ash can
            suffocate plants, animals, and humans. When hot volcanic materials mix with water from streams or melted
            snow and ice, mudflows form. Mudflows have buried entire communities located near erupting volcanoes.

            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami ">TSUNAMI
                </a>
            </h3>

            A tsunami is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water,
            generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions
            (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or
            below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami.
            https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tsunami.html
            Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. But as the waves
            travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases. The speed of
            tsunami waves depends on ocean depth rather than the distance from the source of the wave. Tsunami waves may
            travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching shallow waters.
